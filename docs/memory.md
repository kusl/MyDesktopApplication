Purpose & context
Kushal is developing "MyDesktopApplication," a cross-platform desktop application using Avalonia UI and .NET 10 on Fedora Linux. The project has evolved from a basic counter demo into a comprehensive Country Quiz game featuring statistical comparisons between countries across multiple metrics (population, GDP, area, etc.). The application targets multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, with emphasis on responsive design that works from small Android phones to large tablets.
Key architectural principles include Clean Architecture patterns with separate Core, Infrastructure, Shared, and platform-specific projects, strict adherence to completely free and open-source dependencies (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, or Public Domain licenses only), modern .NET technologies including SLNX solution format and Central Package Management, and a "One Team, One Build" philosophy that eliminates development silos between platform teams.
The project uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite for local storage and PostgreSQL support, implements Repository pattern with Unit of Work, and maintains comprehensive testing strategies across unit, integration, and UI tests. Data persistence is crucial for maintaining game state, scores, and user progress across application sessions.
Current state
The application is actively being debugged and refined through systematic build error resolution. Recent focus has been on harmonizing property naming conventions throughout the codebase (standardizing on names like "CurrentScore" vs "Score" and "Gdp" vs "GdpTotal"), implementing missing extension methods for QuestionType enum to handle country data formatting, and resolving Entity Framework configuration issues including proper DbContext setup and design-time factory implementation.
Current technical stack includes Avalonia UI for cross-platform UI, Entity Framework Core with SQLite, modern testing frameworks (Shouldly instead of FluentAssertions, NSubstitute instead of Moq), and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. The Android development environment has been successfully configured on Fedora Linux with proper Java JDK setup and Android SDK installation.
Key learnings & principles
Shell script automation is strongly preferred over manual file editing for reproducibility and efficiency. Kushal consistently requests comprehensive, executable scripts that can be run multiple times safely (idempotent) rather than step-by-step manual instructions.
Strict licensing discipline is maintained - any packages with commercial licensing restrictions or paid tiers are immediately replaced with free alternatives. This includes replacing FluentAssertions with Shouldly, Moq with NSubstitute, and avoiding any dependencies that could create future licensing complications.
Build issues require surgical, targeted fixes rather than comprehensive file rewrites to avoid introducing new problems. When fixing compilation errors, it's crucial to preserve existing functionality and XAML bindings rather than accidentally removing essential properties or methods.
Platform-specific build problems (particularly Android aapt2 daemon deadlocks) can be resolved by creating separate solution files for daily development while maintaining full platform builds for CI/CD scenarios.
Approach & patterns
Development follows a systematic debugging methodology: analyze build errors comprehensively, create targeted fix scripts that address root causes rather than symptoms, verify fixes through build and test execution, and maintain idempotent scripts that can be safely re-run.
Project structure consolidation is regularly performed to remove redundant shell scripts and duplicate solution files that accumulate during development iterations. This includes maintaining a single unified solution file and standardizing on dotnet build and dotnet test commands.
CI/CD workflows are structured into three distinct pipelines: ci.yml for desktop-only builds on every push/PR, build.yml for creating development pre-releases with all platforms, and release.yml for stable releases on git tags. This separation allows fast feedback loops while maintaining comprehensive platform coverage.
Error resolution follows a pattern of killing stuck build processes, cleaning build artifacts, applying targeted fixes, restoring packages, and verifying through compilation and testing.
Tools & resources
Development environment: Fedora Linux with .NET 10, Java JDK properly configured for Android development, Android SDK with command-line tools for cross-platform builds.
Key technologies: Avalonia UI framework, Entity Framework Core with SQLite, SLNX solution format with Central Package Management, GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.
Testing stack: Shouldly for assertions, NSubstitute for mocking, comprehensive unit and integration test coverage with xunit framework.
Database tooling: EF Core migrations with design-time factory pattern, support for both SQLite (local development) and PostgreSQL (production scenarios).
The project maintains real-world country data from sources like World Bank and UN statistics for the quiz functionality, with 50+ countries including comprehensive demographic and economic indicators.
