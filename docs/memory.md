Purpose & context
Kushal is developing MyDesktopApplication, a cross-platform desktop application using Avalonia UI and .NET 10 on Fedora Linux. The project has evolved from a basic counter demo into a comprehensive Country Quiz game featuring statistical comparisons between countries across metrics like population, GDP, area, and other demographics. The application targets both desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and Android, with a strong emphasis on maintaining a unified solution structure rather than platform-specific silos.
The project follows Clean Architecture principles with separate Core, Infrastructure, Shared, Desktop, and Android projects. Kushal maintains strict licensing requirements, accepting only completely free dependencies (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, Public Domain) and explicitly rejecting packages with commercial tiers or restrictive licensing. The architecture implements Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence, the Repository pattern with Unit of Work, and MVVM using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.
Current state
The application is actively being debugged and stabilized, with recent focus on resolving Android build issues including aapt2 daemon hangs during resource compilation and AppCompat theme compatibility problems. The desktop version is functional with a working Country Quiz game featuring 50+ countries with real statistical data, persistent game state tracking, and comprehensive unit tests.
Current technical challenges include Android SDK configuration on Fedora Linux, Java JDK version management (preferring JDK 21/17/11 over Java 25), and Entity Framework migration setup requiring proper design-time context factories. The project uses modern .NET technologies including SLNX solution format and Central Package Management, with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for automated building and testing across multiple platforms.
Key learnings & principles
Kushal has established several core principles: "One Team, One Build" approach avoiding platform-specific development silos, comprehensive automation through shell scripts rather than manual configuration, and systematic debugging using process monitoring and build artifact analysis. A critical insight is that Android builds can hang indefinitely due to aapt2 daemon deadlocks, requiring specific MSBuild properties like AndroidUseAapt2Daemon=false to resolve.
The project has demonstrated that maintaining a single unified solution is preferable to splitting into multiple solutions, as "splitting one problem into multiple solutions creates two problems instead." Build errors should be fixed properly rather than worked around through package downgrades or functionality removal. All scripts should be idempotent and include proper cleanup of stuck processes and build artifacts.
Approach & patterns
Development follows a systematic approach using comprehensive bash scripts for setup, debugging, and fixes rather than manual file editing. Each script includes process cleanup (killing stuck aapt2/VBCSCompiler processes), build artifact cleaning, targeted fixes, package restoration, and verification steps with clear success/failure reporting.
Problem-solving methodology involves using project knowledge search tools to analyze codebases systematically, starting with broad error terms then narrowing to specific class names and method signatures. Build issues are diagnosed through process monitoring, log analysis, and iterative testing. The approach emphasizes surgical fixes over comprehensive rewrites when addressing specific compilation errors.
Tools & resources
The development environment centers on Fedora Linux with .NET 10, Avalonia UI framework, and Entity Framework Core with SQLite. Android development requires proper Android SDK installation (not just android-tools package) with command-line tools from Google. Java configuration management ensures JDK availability over JRE-only installations.
Key dependencies include CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for MVVM implementation, Shouldly for testing assertions (replacing FluentAssertions), NSubstitute for mocking (replacing Moq), and Entity Framework Core with both SQLite and PostgreSQL providers. GitHub Actions workflows use latest action versions (checkout v6, setup-dotnet v5, setup-java v5 with Temurin distribution) with separate pipelines for CI, development builds, and releases.
