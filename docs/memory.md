Purpose & context
Kushal is developing a cross-platform desktop application called "MyDesktopApplication" using Avalonia UI and .NET 10 on Fedora Linux. The project aims to be production-ready with modern development practices, supporting multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. Success is measured by having a robust, automated development environment with comprehensive CI/CD pipelines and clean architecture patterns.
Key requirements include using the latest .NET technologies (SLNX solution format, Central Package Management), implementing clean architecture with separate Core, Infrastructure, Shared, and platform-specific projects, and maintaining strict licensing compliance - only accepting MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, or Public Domain licensed dependencies. The project uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite and PostgreSQL support, implements Repository pattern with Unit of Work, and includes comprehensive testing strategies.
Current state
Kushal has successfully progressed from initial setup failures to a working Android development environment through systematic troubleshooting. Recent achievements include resolving Java configuration issues on Fedora (properly configuring Java 21 JDK instead of Java 25 JRE), fixing GitHub Actions CI failures by restructuring workflows to separate desktop-only builds from full platform builds, installing the official Android SDK with proper environment configuration, and resolving C# compilation errors including namespace conflicts and inheritance issues in Android project files.
The development environment now supports building for all target platforms with three distinct CI workflows: desktop-only builds for every push/PR, pre-releases with all platforms, and tagged releases.
Approach & patterns
Kushal strongly prefers automation through shell scripts over manual file editing, consistently requesting scripted solutions for setup, dependency management, Android SDK configuration, and workflow creation. This preference stems from valuing reproducible, automated development processes that minimize manual copy-pasting and reduce setup errors.
The development approach follows systematic troubleshooting methodology, addressing issues in logical sequence (Java configuration → CI workflows → SDK installation → compilation errors). Kushal provides detailed feedback and corrections throughout the process, demonstrating thorough testing of proposed solutions and clear communication of platform-specific issues.
Key learnings & principles
Several important technical insights have emerged: Fedora's android-tools package only includes adb and fastboot, not the full Android SDK required for building applications; Java configuration on Linux requires careful attention to JDK vs JRE installations and proper PATH configuration; GitHub Actions workflows need careful separation between desktop-only and full platform builds to avoid unnecessary dependency installation; and cross-platform .NET development requires attention to namespace conflicts and platform-specific inheritance patterns.
The principle of strict licensing compliance has proven non-negotiable, with packages being rejected solely based on commercial licensing requirements regardless of technical merit.
Tools & resources
The development stack centers on .NET 10 with Avalonia UI framework, Entity Framework Core with SQLite and PostgreSQL databases, and comprehensive testing frameworks for unit, integration, and UI testing. The environment runs on Fedora Linux with official Android SDK command-line tools, proper Java 21 JDK configuration, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD across Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android platforms.
Development automation relies heavily on custom shell scripts for project setup, dependency management, and environment configuration, supporting the preference for reproducible, scripted workflows over manual processes.Tell Claude what to remember or forget...
