Purpose & context
Kushal is developing "MyDesktopApplication," a cross-platform country quiz game built with Avalonia UI and .NET 10. The application challenges users to compare countries across various metrics (population, GDP, area, literacy rates, etc.) and maintains persistent game state with score tracking. The project targets multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS (both x64 and ARM64), and Android, with a strong emphasis on maintaining a unified codebase rather than platform-specific silos.
The project follows Clean Architecture principles with separate Core, Infrastructure, Shared, and platform-specific projects, using Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence. Kushal operates under a strict "free of cost" philosophy, requiring all dependencies to use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, or Public Domain) and explicitly avoiding packages with commercial licensing restrictions. The development environment is Fedora Linux, and the project uses modern .NET technologies including SLNX solution format and Central Package Management.
Current state
The application is actively being refined through systematic debugging and optimization. Recent focus areas include resolving Android build stability issues (particularly aapt2 daemon hangs), fixing UI/UX problems with touch targets and value precision display, and maintaining proper CI/CD pipeline functionality. The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases, with Obtainium for Android app distribution.
Current technical challenges involve managing cross-platform compatibility while maintaining code quality, ensuring proper Entity Framework migrations work correctly, and resolving occasional build hanging issues during Android resource compilation. The codebase includes comprehensive unit and integration tests, with ongoing efforts to maintain zero build errors across all platforms.
Key learnings & principles
Kushal has established several core development principles: "One Team, One Build" approach where all developers work with the same unified solution rather than creating platform-specific development silos, systematic problem-solving through comprehensive shell scripts rather than manual fixes, and strict adherence to free/open-source licensing to avoid commercial dependencies.
Key technical insights include understanding that Android build hangs are often caused by aapt2 daemon deadlocks requiring specific MSBuild properties (AndroidUseAapt2Daemon=false), the importance of proper Java JDK configuration (avoiding JRE-only installations), and the need for AppCompat themes when using Avalonia on Android. The project has evolved from initially using deprecated packages (Avalonia.ReactiveUI, FluentAssertions with commercial restrictions) to modern, freely-licensed alternatives.
Approach & patterns
Kushal consistently prefers automated solutions delivered as executable shell scripts over manual step-by-step instructions, stating a strong preference for "using shell scripts instead of manually editing individual files." Problem-solving follows a systematic approach: comprehensive analysis of build errors, creation of idempotent fix scripts that can run multiple times safely, and thorough testing to ensure solutions don't introduce regressions.
Development workflow emphasizes maintaining a single unified solution file, using GitHub's run_number for automatic versioning to enable proper Android app updates, and implementing comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with separate workflows for continuous integration, development builds, and production releases. The approach prioritizes fixing root causes rather than implementing workarounds or downgrading packages.
Tools & resources
The development stack centers on .NET 10 with Avalonia UI for cross-platform desktop and mobile development, Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence, and CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for MVVM patterns. Testing uses Shouldly for assertions and NSubstitute for mocking, both chosen for their permissive licensing.
The CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions with the latest action versions (checkout@v6, setup-dotnet@v5, setup-java@v5 with Temurin distribution), supporting builds for six desktop platforms plus Android. Android development requires proper SDK setup on Fedora Linux, and the project uses Obtainium for APK distribution rather than traditional app stores. Database migrations are managed through custom shell scripts that provide proper validation and error handling.Tell Claude what to remember or forget...
