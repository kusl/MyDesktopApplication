I want to learn Avalonia UI to write high performance cross platform free of cost. 
I want to use the latest and greatest technology. 
I want this to serve as a sample as well as a starting point for native applications. 
It should be easy to use the latest dotnet technology 
such as slnx files, props files, and so on. 
Where possible, we should use long term sustainable technology such as sqlite and postgresql. 
We should avoid any nuget package that requires payment of money, free of cost for non-commercial software is not enough. 
We ourselves should not charge any money, ever. 
We should have extensive logging, metrics, etc using open telemetry. 
Application should be built from the ground up to be testable.
All tests including Unit tests, integration tests should be automated and be performant so we can run them after every change. 
The whole thing should fit in a single git repository.
